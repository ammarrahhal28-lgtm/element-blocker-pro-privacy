    <h1>Privacy Policy — Element Blocker Pro</h1>
    <p>
        Element Blocker Pro does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from users.
    </p>
    <p>
        All extension functionality runs locally in the user's browser. The extension only uses 
        <strong>chrome.storage</strong> to save user preferences such as blocked element selectors 
        and profile settings. These settings remain on the user's device and are never shared with 
        third parties or external servers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The extension does not track browsing history, monitor user activity, or access any data 
        from visited websites other than what is necessary to hide user-selected elements.
    </p>
